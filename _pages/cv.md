Education
======
* M.S. in Data Science, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, FAU
* B.Tech. in Computer Science, National Institute of Technology(NIT), Srinagar.

Work experience
======

* Oct 2023 – May 2024: Research Assistant at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg
  * Implemented cutting-edge learning algorithms such as RNNs for spiking neural networks, enhancing model performance, and contributing to the field of neuromorphic computing.
  * Developed spiking neural network models in PyTorch and Lava-dl to simulate Drosophila larva behavior.
  * Collaborated on a multidisciplinary project, applying novel computational approaches to streamline experiments on Drosophila, improving speed, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness.

* Sep 2023 – Mar 2024: Master's Thesis - Generative AI at BMW AG Group
  * AI-based generation of 2D vehicle geometries through Natural Language. Integrated traditional NLP with generative AI techniques to boost language understanding in vehicle design system.
  * Prompt Engineering and finetuning of Large Language Models(LLMs) such as GPT-4, LLAMA-2, Mistral, etc using PEFT techniques like LoRA, qLoRA, etc on the use case to accurately transform language into a car silhouette.
  * Engineered self-correction mechanism using prompt engineering and LLM-as-judge, improving output accuracy and efficiency in vehicle generation.

* Nov 2022 – Apr 2023: Data Science Intern at BMW AG Group
  * Implementation, documentation, and internal presentation of a cloud application for extracting text from PDFs provided by BMW suppliers.
  * Developed a data pipeline to automate text extraction from newly received PDFs utilizing different AWS services, SQL, PySpark and other relevant tools, resulting in over 90% reduction in manual effort and 99% accuracy of the extracted text.
  * Creation and maintenance of dashboards in PowerBI and Palatir Imagine for use in different production settings.

* May 2022 – Nov 2022: Research Assistant at Philipps University Marburg
*   Tailored various state-of-the-art deep learning methods like transformers and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) for multimodal generation tasks on art datasets.
*   Researched and implemented cutting-edge Diffusion models and VQGAN+CLIP architectures, leading to over 10% performance improvement in image-text retrieval tasks.
*   Preprocessed and structured image metadata (XML parsing, cleaning, formatting) to optimize retrieval methods.
